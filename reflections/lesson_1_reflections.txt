#Viewing a diff made finding the error much more time efficient. That way I didnt have to compare every line by myself visually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

#Doing this would make it very easy to see what Ive done and even share mistakes with others, or find out how I did something to make it work in the past but forgot how.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

#I tend to get really focused and a project and then forget to save or save after its been way too long and the project is really different than from where I started.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

#Google docs generally dont require more than one file for a project where websites need at least two files together to function properly.

#How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log lets me see what changes Ive made at certain points and then I can compare one save to another throught the git diff command

#How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now I know that if I make a mistake I can easily go back to a previous version where everything still works

#Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Ill be using git for the javascript course and eventually to do web design on my own
